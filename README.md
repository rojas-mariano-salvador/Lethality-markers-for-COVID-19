The repository codes are based on the manuscript under revision 
"Lethality risk markers by sex and age-group for COVID-19 in Mexico: a cross-sectional study based on machine learning approach" 
therefore any partial or total code extraction should be referenced into this repository.

The purpose of our study was to identify how the lethality of COVID-19 relates to the risk markers in groups stratified by sex and age, and to apply the virtues of machine learning to identify health risks. 

The source of information was the cases reported to the National Epidemiological Surveillance System (SINAVE), under the Federal Health Secretariat of Mexico, and retrieved from an open-access database generated by the Institute for Research in Applied Mathematics and Systems (IIMAS) of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. 

The source dataset of COVID-19 cases is available at  http://covid-19.iimas.unam.mx/
