## Lethality risk markers by sex and age-group for COVID-19 in Mexico: a cross-sectional study based on machine learning approach

In this repository we present the code used for training machine learning models for the classification and identification of risck markers of lethality in male and female patients with COVID-19 from Mexico.

## Brief introduction
This repository is organized as follows:
* Training: this folder contains in different notebooks of code, the patient selection and pre-processing of open-database, training of models and evaluation metrics.     
* Risk markers: this folder contains the code used for  to identify risk markers through an interpretability approach, it includes the feature importance, the summary plot and waterfall plots for individual predictions. 

## Requirements
* Python 3.8
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* XGBoost
* SHAP

## Database
The source of information was the cases reported to the National Epidemiological Surveillance System (SINAVE) under the Federal Health Secretariat of Mexico. These cases were retrieved from an open-access database available by [National Autonomous University of Mexico](https://www.unam.mx/). 

The source dataset is available at [URL](http://covid-19.iimas.unam.mx/).
